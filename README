This branch is used to test the difference between the unrolled kernel "dev_UniformUpdateRHS" and a version of the same kernel with indices in the arrays defined through contant memory variables:

1) Added indices as variables in constant memory
2) Added nested calls to internal dev_functions


Profiling results are saved into the "res" folder
