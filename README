This branch is used to test the difference between the original kernel "dev_UniformUpdateRHS" and a version of the same kernel with the following modifications.
The aim of this repo is to test the influence of the stride in the left and right reconstruction.

1) All the sub-kernels have been unrolled into a single kernel
2) The constant memory used to access addresses have been removed
3) The global data are loaded and saved into local const memory
4) the stride of the data is 16 instead of 5 (length of line cache).

Profiling results are saved into the "res" folder
