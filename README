This branch is used to test the difference between teh original kernel "dev_UniformUpdateRHS" and a version of the same kernel with the following modifications:

1) All the sub-kernels have been unrolled into a single kernel
2) The constant memory used to access addresses have been removed
3) The global data are loaded and saved into local const memory

Profiling results are saved into the "res" folder
